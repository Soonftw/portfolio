              "The combination programme, Master of Science in Engineering and
              in Education, results in a Master&#8217;s degree and a teaching
              degree from The Royal Institute of Technology within one of the
              subject combinations: mathematics/physics, mathematics/chemistry
              or mathematics/technology, where the&#160;technology subject is
              profiled&#160;towards either information and communication
              technology or energy and environmental science. The programme
              gives both the competencies to work as a pedagogical engineer and
              as a teacher mainly within upper secondary schools and adult
              education institutions.""
